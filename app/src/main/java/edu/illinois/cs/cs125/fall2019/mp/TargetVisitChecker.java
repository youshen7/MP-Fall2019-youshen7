/**
 * Holds methods for managing a path of target claims.
 * <p>
 * The set of locations is represented as a pair of identically sized arrays. The first target's latitude
 * is the first entry in the latitudes array; its longitude is the first entry in the longitudes array.
 * The path array contains indexes of the captured targets in the order they were captured. To ensure
 * that's it's possible to capture all targets, the path array has the same size as the coordinate arrays.
 * If not all targets have been captured yet, unused slots of the path array have the value -1. The path
 * array is filled starting at the beginning, so all instances of -1 are contiguous at the end of the array.
 * <p>
 * For example, if latitudes is [40.2, 40.8], longitudes is [-88.5, -88.3], and path is [1, -1],
 * there are two targets: (40.2, -88.5) and (40.8, -88.3). The target at index 1, that is, (40.8, -88.3),
 * has been captured; the other has not. If path were [-1, -1], that would indicate that the user has
 * captured no targets so far. If path were [0, 1], that would indicate that the user first captured target
 * 0, that is, (40.2, -88.5), and then captured target 1.
 * <p>
 * You need to complete the three functions here. You can then use them to implement the game in
 * the location update handler of GameActivity!
